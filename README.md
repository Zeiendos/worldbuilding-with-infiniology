# Infiniology: A Comprehensive Worldbuilding Framework

> "There may never be an end to the depth of Infiniology. The more you learn, the less you know. This was originally just a project to get a mythology into someone else's world. A world where a character without a soul was told he couldn't use magic. May this framework explain the fundamentals of what makes a world a reality. While leading you to the creation of in-depth stories shaped by your own imagination."
> - Zeiendos

## 📚 Overview

Infiniology is a comprehensive worldbuilding framework that provides writers, game designers, and storytellers with a systematic approach to creating mythologies, magic systems, and coherent fictional realities. Originally developed to explain how a character without a soul could use magic, this framework has evolved into a complete system for understanding what makes a world a reality.
